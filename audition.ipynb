Runners are tracking and collecting data with gadgets (smartphones, watches or sport trackers) to keep themselves motivated. People are competitive and, by nature, are striving to get answers for various questions like, for instance:\n",

    "One day I had a chat with my old friend. Since we both are runners, amongst other news we discussed our training habits and achievements. But, while answering his questions I suddenly understood that I had very rough idea about my running statistics. Fortunately, I had my training data collected (thanks for Runkeeper service). Logically, that conversation triggered an idea to analyze stored information properly. All unanswered questions can be addressed by using proper data analytics tools. And the data can tell this unique story of several years of efforts and motivations!\n",
